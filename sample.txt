===page 1===
This is a normally formatted piece of text that should be normally rendered in discord along with *italic*, **bold**, __underlined__, `inline codeblocks` and ~~crossed~~ text.
None of these should ever be modified by the parser.

|/| These are comments and will not be rendered by the parser.

|/
You can also make comments multiline
like this.
/|

Next comes codeblocks.

Codeblocks are to be represented as shown below:

[+label1+]
[+label2+]

The content of the codeblocks are to be specified later in the page using labels and sub-labels to allow for dynamic rendering.

Note that everything upto this point will be rendered in the order you write them in.

Additional components (components that wont be immiediately rendered in text) and contents of codeblocks are to be mentioned after text components as shown below

###---###

$$label1$$
>>>js
for(let i = 0; i < 100; i++){
  console.log(i)
}
>>>py
for i in range(100):
  print(i)
>>>anything
note that the sub-label can be literally anything.
$$label2$$
>>>also
note that content for all codeblocks should be specified or an error will be thrown.

Buttons work similiarly, you need to specify the fields listed below
Some of them have default values
style (defaults to PRIMARY)
label (no default value/ mandatory field)
customId (defaults to a generated value)
url (only necessary for link styled buttons/ mandatory if the button style is link)
disabled (defaults to false)

read more about buttons here: https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#buttons
note: A message can have 5 component rows which can each hold 5 buttons so we can have 5 sets of buttons at most which can each have upto 5 buttons.
a row is enclosed in "::::"
